# Create service guide

## Overview

When a user requests creating a service to call APIs using `umijs request`, follow these steps:

1. Define a variable named `resource` to represent the API endpoint.
2. Create a function CRUD methods:
   - `fetchList`: Used to fetch a list of resources (method: GET).
   - `fetchById`: Used to fetch details of a resource by its ID (method: GET).
   - `create`: Used to create a new resource (method: POST).
   - `update`: Used to update a resource by its ID (method: PUT).
   - `delete`: Used to delete a resource by its ID (method: DELETE).
3. Each method must use the `request` function from `umi`.
4. The code should be concise, easy to understand, and adhere to modern programming standards.
5. Ensure the service is exported as `export`.
6. Always using Typescript

## Define model / type
Allway define type in @src/models/resource.model.ts

## Coding Flow

Create file resource.service.ts in @src/services
import resource from '@/model/resource.model'

const resource = 'api/v1/resource'
