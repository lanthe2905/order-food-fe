# Admin Section Guide

## Overview
The admin section is built using UmiJS and Ant Design Pro components. It follows a modular structure with clear separation of concerns.

## Key Features
- User Management
- Workshift Processing
- Dashboard
- Reports

## Directory Structure
- `src/pages/admin/` - Admin pages
  - `dashboard/` - Dashboard components
  - `users/` - User management
  - `workshift-process/` - Workshift processing
  - `reports/` - Reporting features

## Components
- Use Ant Design Pro components when possible
- Custom components should be in `components/admin/`
- Layout components in `components/layout/AdminLayout/`

## Data Management
- Use Dva models for state management
- API calls should be in `services/admin.ts`
- Use `useRequest` hook for data fetching

## Authentication
- Admin routes should be protected
- Use `@umijs/plugin-access` for route access control
- Authentication state in `models/auth.ts`

## Best Practices
1. Use Ant Design Pro components
2. Follow UmiJS conventions
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Use TypeScript for type safety
5. Keep components modular and reusable
